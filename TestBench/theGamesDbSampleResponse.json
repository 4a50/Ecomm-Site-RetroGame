The third game in the Metroid series, it was released in Japan on March 19, 1994, in North America on April 18, and in Europe and Australia on July 28.\r\n\r\nSuper Metroid was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano with Gunpei Yokoi serving as general manager. Super Metroid is a direct sequel to the 1991 game Metroid II: Return of Samus. In the game's story, bounty hunter Samus Aran brought a Metroid larva from the planet SR388 to the Ceres space colony, where scientists believed that they could harness its power. After leaving the colony, Samus received a distress call and returned to find that the Metroid larva was stolen by the Space Pirate leader, Ridley. Samus follows him to the planet Zebes in attempts to retrieve a stolen larva. Super Metroid\u200a'\u200bs gameplay focuses on exploration, and its progression revolves around the search for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. The game introduces new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automapping facility, and the ability to fire in all directions.\r\n\r\nSuper Metroid received critical acclaim, and is considered by critics to be one of the greatest video games of all time, owing to its great use of atmosphere, gameplay, audio, cinematic elements and graphics. Despite this, the game sold poorly in Japan, but fared better in North America and Europe. Super Metroid became popular among players for speedrunning, and its gameplay and design influenced other games, such as Shadow Complex and Axiom Verge. The close releases and similar gameplay concepts of Super Metroid and Konami's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night resulted in the foundations of the \"Metroidvania\" genre. The game was followed by the 2002 release of Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime, ending the series' eight-year hiatus. Super Metroid became available as a Virtual Console title for the Wii console in 2007, and for the Wii U in 2013.",

The hack gameplay focus on puzzles, exploration and challenges. The focus on puzzles is stronger than most hacks. However there is multiple ways to advance or solve a problem. This is my first real attempt at hacking, there could be some weird moments of me trying stuff :D, but nothing will be out of place assets or ideas. Metroid for me is a huge alien underground isolated maze and this is what it will be about.\r\n\r\nThe main idea of this hack is like multiple small hacks put into one with a connected progression and world. So its more levels based. (multiple zones)\r\nWith map portions closing behind you at the end of the zone.\r\nYou will see where it ends on the map ingame.\r\nStart at the abyss of the planet and ascend your way up to the surface.\r\n\r\nWill you be able to defeat the black parasites and reach the extraction point ? find out in ascent",
